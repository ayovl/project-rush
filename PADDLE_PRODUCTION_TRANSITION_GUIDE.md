PADDLE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=pdl_your_production_webhook_secret_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_PADDLE_CLIENT_TOKEN=ct_live_your_production_client_token_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_PADDLE_ENV=production

# Your existing Supabase and other production vars...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_production_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_production_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_production_supabase_service_key
```

### 4.2 Deployment Platform Configuration

**For Vercel:**
1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** â†’ **Environment Variables**
3. Add the production environment variables:

## Step 5: Update Production Price IDs in Code

### 5.1 Update Paddle Configuration
Update `src/lib/paddle.ts` with your production Price IDs:

```typescript
// Product catalog - Production Price IDs
export const PADDLE_PRODUCTS: Record<string, PaddleProduct> = {
  basic: {
    priceId: 'pri_your_production_basic_price_id', // Replace with actual production price ID
    planId: 'basic',
    name: 'Basic Plan',
    price: '$4/month',
    description: 'Founding Member Price'
  },
  pro: {
    priceId: 'pri_your_production_pro_price_id', // Replace with actual production price ID
    planId: 'pro',
    name: 'Pro Plan',
    price: '$9/month',
    description: 'Founding Member Price'
  },
  ultimate: {
    priceId: 'pri_your_production_ultimate_price_id', // Replace with actual production price ID
    planId: 'ultimate',
    name: 'Ultimate Plan',
    price: '$29/month',
    description: 'Founding Member Price'
  }
}
```

### 5.2 Commit and Deploy Changes

git add src/lib/paddle.ts
git commit -m "Update Paddle price IDs for production"
git push
```

## Step 6: Production Deployment and Testing

### 6.1 Deploy to Production
1. Deploy your application with the updated environment variables
2. Ensure the production URL matches your webhook URL in Paddle
3. Verify the deployment is successful

### 6.2 Production Testing Checklist
Test these critical flows in production:

**Payment Testing:**
- [ ] Create test subscription with real payment method (use small amount first)
- [ ] Verify customer creation in Paddle dashboard
- [ ] Check subscription appears in your Supabase database
- [ ] Test subscription cancellation
- [ ] Verify webhook delivery in Paddle dashboard

**User Experience Testing:**
- [ ] Test checkout flow from your pricing page
- [ ] Verify success page redirects correctly  
- [ ] Test user account page shows subscription status
- [ ] Verify user can access paid features after payment

**Email Notifications:**
- [ ] Customer receives payment confirmation email from Paddle
- [ ] Subscription updates trigger appropriate emails
- [ ] Cancellation emails are sent correctly

## Step 7: Monitor Production Setup

### 7.1 Paddle Dashboard Monitoring
Monitor these sections regularly:
- **Revenue**: Track incoming payments
- **Customers**: Monitor new customer signups
- **Subscriptions**: Track subscription lifecycle
- **Webhooks**: Ensure all webhooks are being delivered successfully

### 7.2 Application Monitoring
- Monitor your application logs for any Paddle-related errors
- Set up alerts for failed webhook processing
- Track user subscription status in your database

### 7.3 Key Metrics to Watch
- **Webhook Success Rate**: Should be >99%
- **Payment Success Rate**: Monitor for failed payments
- **Customer Support**: Be ready to handle payment-related inquiries

## ðŸš¨ Important Production Considerations

### Security
- **Never expose production API keys**: Only use client-side tokens in frontend
- **Webhook Security**: Your webhook endpoint automatically verifies signatures
- **HTTPS Required**: Ensure your production site uses HTTPS
- **Environment Variables**: Never commit production keys to version control

### Compliance
- **Tax Handling**: Paddle handles tax compliance automatically
- **GDPR/Privacy**: Ensure your privacy policy covers payment processing
- **Terms of Service**: Update terms to reflect payment processing

### Customer Support
- **Paddle Customer Portal**: Customers can manage subscriptions at checkout.paddle.com
- **Refund Process**: Handle refunds through Paddle dashboard or API
- **Failed Payments**: Paddle will attempt retry payments automatically

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting Production Issues

### Common Production Issues:

**Webhooks Not Being Received:**
1. Check webhook URL is publicly accessible
2. Verify webhook secret matches environment variable
3. Check Paddle dashboard for delivery attempts and errors
4. Ensure your server can handle POST requests to `/api/webhooks/paddle`

**Checkout Not Working:**
1. Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_PADDLE_CLIENT_TOKEN` is production token
2. Check Price IDs are production values
3. Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_PADDLE_ENV=production`
4. Check browser console for JavaScript errors

**Database Issues:**
1. Verify Supabase production connection
2. Check that production Supabase has the correct schema
3. Ensure service role key has correct permissions

**Payment Failures:**
1. Check Paddle dashboard for declined payments
2. Verify business verification is complete
3. Ensure banking details are verified
4. Monitor for any API errors in logs
